Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was a client interested in expanding their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a multi-platform application that could support web and potentially other operating systems. They wanted a software design that could handle player and team management, ensure unique names for games and teams, and support scalable, multi-user interactions. The goal was to create a web-based, distributed system that could serve multiple users across various platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did particularly well in clearly outlining the technical requirements, design constraints, and evaluation of different operating platforms. By using detailed sections like memory management, storage management, and security, I provided a comprehensive overview that would be easy for both developers and non-technical team members to understand.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document allowed me to break down complex requirements and see how different design choices would impact each other. It helped me better understand the importance of patterns like Singleton and Iterator in controlling the application’s state and ensuring scalability. Having a clear design also provided a helpful roadmap for coding, so I could focus on specific features and avoid unnecessary rework.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, I’d focus more on the System Architecture View. Although this wasn’t required, adding a basic architectural diagram could help visualize how each component interacts, especially with a client-server setup. This addition would give the client a clearer understanding of the system’s structure and help developers see how their work fits into the larger picture.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on key requirements, such as scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and ease of user interaction with teams and games. Addressing these needs directly in the design made it clear that user experience and accessibility were top priorities. Considering the user’s needs is essential because it ensures that the software is both practical and enjoyable for them, which ultimately impacts the software’s success and adoption.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing the software by breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable sections and aligning each part of the design with a specific user need or technical constraint. Moving forward, I’d continue using this structured approach, incorporating more user feedback in the early stages and potentially using agile techniques like iterative design. Techniques like prototyping and using more visual aids (like UML diagrams or flowcharts) would also help make the design process clearer and more collaborative.
